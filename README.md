# FTPapp
Application for uploading and downloading files using FileZilla

## Description

This application was made as a task when I was doing an apprenticeship in Infobip.  
It was also my first contact with Java development, and software engineering.   

The project has been discontinued, I'm leaving it on my github for the sake of visibility of the progress I've made since.

### Usage

If you're so inclined, you'll have to set up a server with FileZilla on your local machine. 
Download the code and start it from the IDE of your choice.
